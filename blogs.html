          Introduction: In the discussion below, I will be analysing what data
          visualisation is as well as the important role it serves in a society
          with developing technology that is constantly improving.
        </p>

          What is data visualisation? The reading ‘Overview of Data
          Visualisation’ by Li states several varying definitions of data
          visualisation showcasing that it is a broad term. My understanding of
          the reading has led me to realise that data visualisation is when data
          is taken and reproduced into some type of visual form so that the
          receivers of the data may truly understand what the data represents
          thereby increasing cognition. (Li 2020: 18-19) The representation of
          data visually simplifies it for the reader by decreasing the
          overbearing load of information that they would have had to struggle
          to understand if it was not done in a visual manner/form. Not only
          does this increase readability but it also enhances understanding and
          accessibility of the data. Data visualisation makes use of visual
          elements like tables, charts, graphs, and maps to convey data in a way
          that makes the information clear and effective in what it represents
          so that the reader may gain insight and identify patterns within the
          data. Data visualisation is highly significant in a number of fields
          like science, academia, business and many more showing its popularity
          in differing industries. (Li 2020: 18-19) What are the two types of
          data visualisation? Data visualisation branches into two types or
          fields namely information visualisation and scientific visualisation.
          These may be two types of data visualisation, but they still convert
          ‘’data into a visual form’’ so that the information being presented
          becomes understandable increasing the knowledge and insight gained
          from engaging with them. (Li 2020: 19) Information visualisation
          represents abstract data or knowledge in a visual form so that users
          gain a deeper understanding of it as well as can determine common
          patterns within the data thereby assisting them in making informed
          decisions using the data. Information data can be represented in
          several ways like tree maps, scatter plots, and tree diagrams. In
          information visualisation the content of the data should always be
          considered before deciding how to best represent it visually. This is
          so that the data becomes more effective and clearer for users.
          Scientific visualisation represents scientific data which usually
          centres around physicality like the human body. This type of
          visualisation is very important in validating scientific hypotheses as
          well as assisting people in communicating their ideas/findings more
          effectively. “Simulations, waveforms, or volume” are the ways in which
          scientific visualisation can be represented and these are usually done
          using 3D modelling. The reason for discussing the two fields of data
          visualisation was to show that it is a very flexible and broad term as
          it is used in two ways to represent data of two entirely different
          topics showing its capabilities in a range of fields. (Li 2020: 19-22)
          The importance of data visualisation and choosing the right form: From
          the above discussion it can be noted that data visualisation plays an
          important role in many fields in representing data so that users can
          easily grasp the concepts, patterns, and information that the data is
          addressing and providing. Data being visually appealing referring to
          how concise, and readable it is, heightens the retrieval of
          information as well as the impact it has on its users. This means that
          a larger group of users can understand what they are engaging with.
          Data can most definitely be represented as it is but that would
          increase difficulty, and indecisiveness of what the data is
          representing as well as creating an overbearing amount of information
          that the user will have to rummage through to understand what is
          happening. This can repel users and create more confusion than
          insight. Data visualisation is all about making information
          accessible, readable, and concise so that user’s cognition and
          understanding is enhanced. It is just as important to know what forms
          of data visualisation can be used for certain types of data as this
          also impacts how the data is received and read. Some of the forms of
          data visualisation include trees, maps, scatter plots, and charts.
          Each one more suitable for a specific kind of data. For example, trees
          are used to represent a hierarchical structure in data with its
          branches usually representing relationships that exist within the
          data. Alternatively, charts are useful in representing quantitative
          data like size and numbers. (Li 2020: 19-29) Conclusion: Throughout
          the discussion, data visualisation has become a common concept as well
          as a significant one. The role it plays in creating data that is more
          accessible, visually stimulating, and easier to understand explains
          why it is so popular in several fields like business, science,
          journalism and more. Data visualisation communicates information
          drastically better between not only scholars but the public as well,
          ensuring that the people who need to know about the information and
          the people who want to know about the information are both equally
          aware of what the data is representing. A bonus aspect of data
          visualisation is that it allows for information to be visually
          pleasing to the human eye. This aspect assists people in grasping the
          concepts being displayed by the data while making it effortless to
          remember as people are drawn to what is visually pleasing. It can be
          compared to a person who retains information more successfully when
          studying through the use of visual stimuli like colour or little
          annotations because in both cases the visual aspect embeds the
          information while simplifying it when it is being processed. Word
