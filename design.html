        <a>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Expedita voluptatum fuga illum distinctio. Odit laudantium temporibus at autem eveniet. Distinctio natus, in quibusdam maxime ut enim accusamus tempore provident necessitatibus.</a>
        <h4>Goal Alignment:</h4>
        <p>The goal behind my website is to try and showcase the theme of space throughout because I will be using a NASA API as part of the data visualization that I will be engaging with in the next assignment. 
            I am contemplating on using the APOD API as my first choice for this website, however I am very much interested in the 4 other APIs that follow suit in the list. 
            Each design decision was made bearing in mind the type of API I will be using and thereby conveying that decision through the design and layout of my website. 
            I have decided to create a website that is very much simple and concise in the way it presents its information so that the more significant parts of the website like the data-visualisation and data-art page will have more of a spotlight. 
            The simplicity of my website can be viewed right from the homepage with the little slideshow that informs the users of each page on the website and what they are all about. 
            I believed that adding a slideshow would make the homepage interesting, easy to navigate, and accessible which is what every website should be. This also assisted in keeping the information to a minimum therefore not instantly overwhelming the user with too many things at once.

        <h5>Style Process Documentation:</h5>
        <p>The visual aesthetic of my website encapsulates the idea of space, a topic that is very interesting and very beautiful to look at.
             The reason for this aesthetic was developed on the idea that I will be using the APOD API which is all about astronomy pictures of the day. 
             Therefore, I tried to incorporate my own pictures that I downloaded from unsplash to convey the type of API I am going to be using.
              I decided to go with the darker visuals with pops of colour here and there so that the website is still aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but it does not distract from the reason for why the website exists. 
            
              Since this assignment is a prototype, these decisions are prone to development and change. 
            This also means that I did not include every aspect of visual material that I wanted to because it did not fit the aesthetic I was going for with this assignment. 
            </p>

            <p>The fonts, colours, and layout were all constructed with the theme of space.
                 Therefore, I chose colours that symbolise space which are the darker colours like blues, blacks, and greys. 
                 Alongside those my website also includes white, yellows, oranges, reds, and greens to provide a pop of colour because I though just have the darker colours would make the website very dull and boring. 
                 These colours can all be found in the backgrounds I decided to use throughout my website. I chose white for the writing as well because it contrasts well against the darker backgrounds. I used a light blue for the containers to add that extra bit of colour and friendliness to my website. The fonts I made use of in this website are the fantasy and cursive font. The fantasy font fits great with the theme of space because well being neat it still adds a bit of character to my website. </p>
